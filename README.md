## Files and Folders

### [PathFind](https://github.com/0xDarkStar/TurtleGame/tree/main/PathFind)

Contains all the files for the pathfinding for enemies.

- [a_star.py](https://github.com/0xDarkStar/TurtleGame/blob/main/PathFind/a_star.py):
    Makes a class that has a lot of functions and several attributes. I don't understand them. :/
- [graph.py](https://github.com/0xDarkStar/TurtleGame/blob/main/PathFind/graph.py):
    Makes a class that deals with the graph (nodes, what node is connected to what other node, and how many neighbors that node has
- [pathing.py](https://github.com/0xDarkStar/TurtleGame/blob/main/PathFind/pathing.py):
    Makes all the nodes and what those nodes are connected to. Has a dictionary for where each node is on the map. 
    Finds where the enemy and the player is, then tries to make the shortest path to the player. Once a path is made, it moves one step in it

### [lvls](https://github.com/0xDarkStar/TurtleGame/tree/main/lvls):

Contains all the levels, a file that has functions to draw the level, a guide on how to make your own levels, and a folder with all the images used in the guide.
